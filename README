There is nothing easier!
Use UTMP Jeber and once for all remove them from your system and your live!

* UTMP Jeber - what is it?

 It's a simple tool, which looks for a suspect UTMP database entries.
 It has come into existance in as a result of interraction with users'
 frustration. Users are frustrated, when they are present in UTMP
 even they are not connected to a system. It can happend when KILL
 is delivered to some processes (e.g screen), or when connection
 is reset by peer.
 
 Users get nervous, because it makes other users bad informed.
 It can make them nervous on systems, which users UTMP to limit
 maximum number of login sessions for user. Frustrated users
 are wonted to abuse 'talk root' and 'mail root' commands,
 and that was the main motive to write this small application.

* What UTMP does?

 UTMP Jeber reads proc filesystem and creates processes tree in
 memory. The tree reflects to the current hierarchy of system
 processes. After it creates the tree it checks any entry found
 in UTMP against it. If it find any error it can optionally
 remove the entry from database.
 
 Jeber has a various methods for checking validity of data
 found in UTMP. The most safe and sure are selected automaticaly.
 
 To see the possible checking methods and other options just
 type in the command line: utmp-jeber -h

* Methods:

 name:		l-seek
 default:	yes
 level:	safe
 summary:	it checks whether login process exists

-------------------------------------------------------------

 name:		u-seek
 default:	yes
 level:		neutral
 summary:	it checks whether any user process exists
		
		this method is not recommended to use
		as an independent check, because it may
		not indicate all broken entries

-------------------------------------------------------------

 name:		pgid-check
 default:	no
 level:		unsafe
 summary:	it checks for existance of processes whith
		PGID equal to PID of the login process,
		or PID of its first child
 
		this method is not recommended while
		removing entries, because it may suggest
		to remove good data

-------------------------------------------------------------
		
 name:		pgid+line-check
 default:	no
 level:		very unsafe
 summary:	it checks for existance of processes whith
		PGID equal to PID of the login process,
		or PID of its first child
		
		additionaly it checks whether found
		processes have a valid terminal line
		name (as found in UTMP)

		this method is not recommended while
		removing entries, because it may suggest
		to remove good data

-------------------------------------------------------------

 name:		inherit-check
 default:	no
 level:		safe
 summary:	it checks whether there are any processes,
		which are children of the login process
		it checks processes' inheritance path
		to obtain parentship relations

-------------------------------------------------------------

 name:		inherit+line-check
 default:	yes
 level:		safe
 summary:	it checks whether there are any processes,
		which are children of the login process
		it checks processes' inheritance path
		to obtain parentship relations

		additionaly it checks whether found
		processes have a valid terminal line
		name (as found in UTMP)

-------------------------------------------------------------

 name:		line-check
 default:	no
 level:		neutral
 summary:	it check whether there are any processes,
		which have some open descriptiors attached
		to the valid terminal device, which name
		is placed in UTMP entry

		this method is not recommended to use
